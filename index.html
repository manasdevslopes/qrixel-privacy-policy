      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date: 2 November, 2025</strong></p>

      <p>
        Qrixel (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information
        Qrixel processes, how it is used, and your choices. Qrixel is a QR code utility that lets you create, customize,
        scan, save, and share QR codes (e.g., UPI links, social profiles, Wi-Fi, phone/SMS/email, text, and websites),
        with optional iCloud sync, Siri Shortcuts/App Intents, deep links, and share extensions.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No account required.</strong> We do not run our own servers for your content.</li>
        <li><strong>Your QR content stays on your device</strong> unless you choose to sync via iCloud or share it.</li>
        <li><strong>No tracking for advertising.</strong> We do not sell or rent your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional iCloud sync.</strong> Sync and backups are provided by Apple and governed by Apple’s policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Support emails you send to us</strong> may include your contact information and message content.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash logs & diagnostics</strong> may be shared with us by Apple if you opt in on your device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2) Information We Process</h2>
      <h3>2.1 On-Device Data (Not transmitted to our servers)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>QR Content You Create:</strong> UPI links, social links (Twitter/X, Instagram, Threads, Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube), Wi-Fi credentials, phone numbers, SMS templates, email mailto links, website URLs, clipboard text, and plain text.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization Assets:</strong> Colors, logos/images you add from the Photos picker or predefined assets, and any overlay text or styling.</li>
        <li><strong>History:</strong> Created and scanned QR codes, including items you pin, copy, share, or delete.</li>
        <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Language preference, app icon choice, and feature toggles (e.g., Siri Shortcuts/App Intents).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of the above stays on your device unless you choose iCloud sync, export, or share externally.</p>

      <h3>2.2 iCloud (Optional)</h3>
      <p>
        If enabled, Qrixel can store your created QR codes and history in your personal iCloud account to sync across your devices.
        iCloud is operated by Apple; we do not control iCloud infrastructure and do not have access to your iCloud content.
        Use of iCloud is subject to Apple’s <em>iCloud Terms</em> and <em>Privacy Policy</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Contact & Support Information</h3>
      <p>
        If you email us (feature requests, bug reports), we will receive the information you provide—such as your name, email address,
        device details you include, and the message content. We use this solely to respond and improve Qrixel.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Diagnostics</h3>
      <p>
        Apple may provide us with <strong>aggregated, de-identified</strong> crash logs and performance diagnostics if you opt in to
        share analytics from your device settings. We use these to improve stability and performance. You can change this preference in
        iOS Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Analytics &amp; Improvements.
      </p>

      <h2>3) Data We Do <em>Not</em> Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No advertising identifiers for tracking users across apps and websites.</li>
        <li>No server-side collection of your QR contents, UPI links, contacts, or images.</li>
        <li>No precise location data.</li>
        <li>No contacts database access (beyond iOS share/email you initiate).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Sharing & Disclosures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>We do not sell or rent your personal data.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Third-party opens:</strong> When you open a UPI link or social profile QR, your device may launch external apps or a web browser (e.g., Google Pay, PhonePe, Twitter/X, Instagram, Threads, Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube). Their privacy practices apply to your activity within their apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Apple (App Store, iCloud, crash reporting) may process data under their own terms and privacy policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, users, or the public.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7) Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-device data:</strong> Remains until you delete items in the app or uninstall Qrixel.</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud data:</strong> Remains until you delete it from Qrixel or manage it via your iCloud settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Support emails:</strong> Retained as long as reasonably necessary to address your request and maintain records, then deleted or archived securely.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To request deletion of support correspondence, email us at
        <a href="mailto:manasdevslopes@gmail.com">manasdevslopes@gmail.com</a>. For device or iCloud data, delete from within the app or manage via iOS/iCloud.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use industry-standard practices and rely on Apple’s platform security for on-device and iCloud storage.
        No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Qrixel is a general-audience utility and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child
        provided personal information to us via support email, contact us and we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>10) International Use & Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your region, Apple’s services (e.g., iCloud, App Store) may store or process data on servers located outside your country.
        By using those features, you acknowledge such processing by Apple under Apple’s terms and policies.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Your Rights & Choices</h2>
